<h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
<h3>User Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Discord Username &amp; User ID:</strong> We collect your Discord name and user ID to create and maintain your game profile and ensure a personalized experience.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Guild Interaction Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Message Activity:</strong> For features like quizzes, the leveling system, cash robbery math quizzes, and other interactive commands, we monitor message activity within guilds.
<br />
<em>Note:</em> We process these messages in real-time to update your experience (e.g., increasing your level as you chat) and do not store the content of your messages.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Server Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Guild Information:</strong> When Kasiko joins a server, we record non-sensitive information such as:
<ul>
<li>Server name</li>
<li>Server owner‚Äôs ID</li>
<li>Date the bot was added</li>
</ul>
This data helps manage the bot‚Äôs functionality across different communities and is removed if Kasiko leaves the server.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Event-Specific Data</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Heaven &amp; Robbery Commands:</strong> These features trigger only when a message contains specific keywords (e.g., north, south, east, west, and ‚Äúrobbery‚Äù) to verify that a user has responded in time. This event data is processed temporarily and then discarded.
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>User Profiles &amp; Progress:</strong> Your Discord username and user ID are used solely for tracking your game progress, such as leveling up based on your activity.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Interactive Features:</strong> Message activity is leveraged to power interactive elements like quizzes and time-based challenges. For example, the quiz feature is designed as a fast-paced, timed challenge that enhances engagement beyond what slash commands can offer.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Server Management:</strong> Server data assists in administering the bot‚Äôs performance and ensuring compatibility with each community‚Äôs settings.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Public Leaderboards &amp; Profiles:</strong> Your username may be displayed publicly on leaderboards (e.g., for orca hunts) and on your in-game profile if you‚Äôre married within the game. This display is intended to promote friendly competition and community interaction.
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> Most data is processed in real-time for immediate functionality and is not stored permanently.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Server Data:</strong> Information regarding servers (such as join dates and owner IDs) is retained only for as long as Kasiko is active on a server.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ephemeral Event Data:</strong> Data used for short-lived events (like quizzes or robbery challenges) is retained only during the event‚Äôs duration and is then discarded.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Security:</strong> We implement reasonable measures to protect your data, though no system can guarantee absolute security.
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
<strong>User Requests:</strong> You may request the deletion of your data at any time. To do so, please email us at <a href="mailto:kasikoinc@gmail.com">kasikoinc@gmail.com</a> or contact us via our Official Kasiko Discord Server.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Permanent Removal:</strong> Once your data is deleted, it cannot be recovered. We are committed to ensuring that all deleted data is permanently removed from our systems.
</p>
<hr />

<h2>6. Public Data Display</h2>
<p>
By using Kasiko, you acknowledge that your Discord username may be displayed publicly on leaderboards and in user profiles (for example, if you participate in global orca hunts or in-game marriages). This public display is an integral part of the interactive community experience provided by the bot.
</p>
<hr />

<h2>7. Bot Permissions</h2>
<p>
<strong>Minimal Access:</strong> Kasiko does not require any moderator or sensitive permissions beyond what is necessary for its functionality. We do not access any personal or sensitive details beyond your Discord username and user ID.

<h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
